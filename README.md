# 20 React Projects

This repository contains 20 different React applications that I've built over the past week using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Each project demonstrates a unique feature, concept, or integration, offering a variety of examples for how to use React in real-world applications.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Feel free to explore each project, learn from them, and create your own versions!

## Setup and Installation

To run these projects, you'll need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer. Clone this repository to a location on your machine, navigate to that location in your terminal, and then run the following commands:

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the application
npm start
These commands will start a local development server, and you should be able to view the project at `localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## Acknowledgments

- This project was inspired by the need to practice and understand React in a practical way.
- Many thanks to the creators of the APIs used in these projects.
